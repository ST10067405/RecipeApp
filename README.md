## Part 1 Changes From Feedback
- Applied changes from my feedback from part 1:
  - Corrected some exception handling.
  - Added support or decimal points (eg. . and ,).
  - Scaling: Although the feedback stated I didnt include scaling options, (like 0.5, 2, 3), which I did.
  - Comments: I added more comments to all classes to enhance code readability and maintainability.
  - Readme file: The readme file was missing plugin data.
  - Code attribution: I added code attribution information in the readme file to give credit where necessary.
  - Exception handling and string manipulation: The feedback suggested that these areas could be improved. I revisited the code and enhanced the exception handling and string manipulation techniques to make them more robust and efficient.
